                        It goes without saying that the air supply plays a decisive role in a 911 Turbo. 
                        But why limit it to the engine? The 911 Turbo Cabriolet models unite the classic silhouette of the 911 Turbo 
                        with the possibility of enjoying the unmistakable sound of the turbo engine even more intensively with the roof open.

                        They are fitted with a fully automatic fabric roof. It has a fixed glass rear screen and three integral magnesium elements that make the roof highly robust and yet particularly lightweight. 
                        The roof opens or closes in around 12 seconds - up to a speed of 50km/h - with the option to operate the mechanism remotely.

                        Remarkably comfortable for a sports car: the rear seats. 
                        As with the front seats, the centre panels of the seat backrests are quilted. 
                        The shelf behind these provides additional storage.
                         Thanks to the folding backrests, the 911 Turbo Coupé models have ample space in the rear for luggage.

                        larger exhaust turbochargers and piezo injectors are used for the first time.
                        Exhaust manifolds derived from the 911 GT2 RS improve responsiveness and efficiency, thanks to optimised flow ratios.

                        Charge-air cooling and engine air intake have been completely redesigned. Previously, air for the intercooler was supplied via side air intakes in the rear wings and the aspirated engine air via a tailgate grille. 
                        This principle has been swapped over in the current 911 Turbo models. This can also be seen from an additional two-tract air outlet for the intercoolers between the tailpipes in the rear apron. 
                        This enables more efficient air flow and charge-air cooling - and thus more power.
